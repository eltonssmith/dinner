# Scotch Scones

A coworker of mine sent me his Scottish Great Grandmother's recipe. This is from the late 19th century and its pretty amazing how something like a scone has hardly changed at all in over 100 years. My one alteration to this recipe is to add orange zest and dried cranberries because I personally enjoy them. More traditionally, scones would contain either raisins, sultanas, or dried currants, so feel free to try those out.

## Ingredients

- [ ] 3.5 cups all purpose flour
- [ ] 1 tsp. salt
- [ ] 1 tsp. baking soda
- [ ] 2 tsp. cream of tartar
- [ ] 2 tsp. sugar
- [ ] 1 Tbsp. vegetable shortening (or lard if you have it, I doubt they had Crisco in Scotland near the turn of the century)
- [ ] 1 egg
- [ ] 1 cup whole milk
- [ ] Zest of one orange
- [ ] 1/2 cup of dried cranberries

## Recipe

1. Sift the flour, baking soda, and cream of tartar into a bowl
1. Add the sugar and salt and mix all the dry ingredients to combine them
1. Add the shortening/lard and mix using your fingers to break up the fat and distribute it throughout the dough in small pieces
1. Add the milk, egg, and any other fruits and mix using a spoon (or keep using your hands) until a soft dough forms
1. Heat up a cast iron skillet on low heat on your stove, lightly grease with thin layer of butter
1. Form the dough into little discs a few inches in diameter and press into the skillet, cooking until all sides are browned and the whole thing feels firm (I think it took 10-20 minutes on my stove)
1. Serve with clotted cream and jam
