# Cornbread

From Alton Brown's excellent guide to baking, "I'm Just Here For More Food."

## Ingredients

- [ ] 203g cornmeal
- [ ] 284g milk
- [ ] 135g all-purpose flour
- [ ] 9g (1 Tbsp.) baking powder
- [ ] 6g (1.5 tsp.) kosher salt
- [ ] 106g vegetable oil
- [ ] 2 large eggs
- [ ] 1 Tbsp. unsalted butter

## Recipe

1. Place a cast iron skillet in the middle rack of your oven and preheat to 450 Fahrenheit (232 C)
1. In a large bowl, combine the cornmeal and milk and allow the cornmeal to soak for 15 minutes
1. In one bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking powder, and salt
1. In another bowl, whisk together the cornmeal and milk mixture along with the eggs and vegetable oil
1. Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl containing the dry ingredients and mix to combine, but be careful not to overmix. You want things to be just combined enough to eliminate big pockets of flour, but not as smooth as cake batter
1. Carefully remove the skillet from the oven using oven mitts, spread butter all around the bottom and sides, then add the batter
1. Bake for 25 minutes
