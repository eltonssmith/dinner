- [ ] 27g water
- [ ] 60g whole milk

Bread Dough:
- [ ] 320g bread flour
- [ ] 9g active dry yeast (could also use instant)
- [ ] 3g fine sea salt
- [ ] 120g whole milk, heated to 90-95 degrees Fahrenheit
- [ ] 56g sugar
- [ ] 3 Tbsp. (42g) softened unsalted butter
- [ ] 1 egg, room temperature

Egg wash:
- [ ] 1 egg
- [ ] 2 Tbsp. whole milk

Garlic butter:
- [ ] 1-2 cloves of garlic, minced
- [ ] 1/4 cup (56g) unsalted butter, melted

## Recipe

1. For the tangzhong, add all ingredients together over medium heat, and constantly whisk until it becomes a paste.
1. Once thick, remove from heat and let it cool to room temperature.
1. For the primed yeast mixture, add the active dry yeast to the warmed milk. Store in a warm area and let sit for 10 minutes.
1. In a stand mixer bowl, add the dry ingredients. Add in milk and yeast mixture, the tangzhong mix, and a whole egg. Mix on low speed, scraping the sides occasionally. 
1. When dough starts coming together, increase speed to medium-low. Gradually add butter until incorporated and nothing sticks to the sides. About 5-7 minutes.
1. Dump dough onto a work surface and roll into a tight ball. 
1. Place dough into a lightly greased bowl and cover with a damp towel. Let rise at room temperature for 1-2 hours, or doubled in size.
1. Punch dough down and dump onto a lightly floured work surface, and divide into 9 equal pieces (75 g each).
1. Lightly grease a 9x9 inch baking dish, roll dough pieces into small tight balls and place into the baking dish in rows of three. Cover with a damp towel and let proof for 1-2 hours. 
1. Brush with egg wash (egg beaten together with a splash of whole milk). Bake in a preheated oven set to 350F for 28-30 minutes. 
1. For the garlic butter, finely chop garlic and add to a cold pan with unsalted butter. Heat over medium heat. Sweat the garlic for 30 seconds and immediately remove from the heat.
1. Remove buns from oven and immediately brush with garlic butter and flaky salt.
