# Negi-Garlic Oil

This is an oil flavored with alliums that is great as a garnish for plenty of dishes, but especially ramen.

## Ingredients

- [ ] 500ml of neutral oil such as rapeseed oil
- [ ] One bunch of Japanese negi (these are a Japanese green onion that's almost leek-like in its thickness) or scallions, chopped into 2 inch pieces
- [ ] A couple of cloves of garlic, smashed

## Recipe

1. Add the chopped negi and garlic along with the oil to a sauce pan over medium heat
1. Once the negi begin to sizzle, adjust the heat to low
1. Allow the whole mixture to sit at a simmer and continue to sizzle for 15-20 minutes. You want to allow for enough time for the flavors to make their way into the oil but don't want to burn the alliums to a crisp
1. Remove from the heat and allow the oil to cool
1. Strain through a fine mesh strainer or cheese cloth and store in an airtight sealed container
