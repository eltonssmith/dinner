# Rosemary Salt

The first food TikTok account that we followed was ThatDudeCanCook, and he seasons everything with this [amazing herbed salt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUaBy42Ibx8&ab_channel=ThatDudeCanCook), which I now always have to keep a supply of in my fridge.

## Ingredients

- [ ] 1 cup Malton sea salt flakes (or kosher salt works fine too)
- [ ] 8 sprigs rosemary (just the needles, discard the stems)
- [ ] 4 sprigs sage (just the leaves)
- [ ] Zest from 2 lemons
- [ ] 3 cloves of garlic

## Recipe

1. Combine all elements in a food processor and pulse long enough to incorporate all ingredients
1. Scrape down the sides and make sure everything gets well mixed. The mixture should look kind of like green sand when its done
1. Store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to two weeks, or freeze and keep it for much longer
