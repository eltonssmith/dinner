# Empanada Dough

## Ingredients

- [ ] 4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (I swap 1/2 cup with whole wheat flour)
- [ ] 1 tablespoon kosher salt
- [ ] 1 cup (8 ounces or 225 grams) cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
- [ ] 2 large eggs
- [ ] 2/3 cup ice water
- [ ] 2 tablespoons white vinegar

## Recipe

1. Sift flour with salt into a large bowl and blend in butter with your fingertips or a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse meal with some (roughly pea-size) butter lumps.
2. Beat together egg, water, and vinegar in a small bowl with a fork. 
3. Add to flour mixture, stirring with fork until just incorporated. (Mixture will look shaggy.) 
4. Turn out mixture onto a lightly floured surface and gather together, then knead gently with heel of your hand once or twice, just enough to bring dough together. (Deb note: If you use a large-ish bowl, you can do this step in-bowl.) 
5. Form dough into two flat rectangles and chill them, each wrapped in plastic wrap, at least 1 hour. Dough can be chilled up to 6 hours total.
