# Soft Boiled Ramen Eggs

## Ingredients

- [ ] 1 cup water
- [ ] 1 cup sake
- [ ] 1/2 cup soy sauce
- [ ] 1/2 cup mirin
- [ ] 1/2 cup sugar
- [ ] 6 eggs

## Recipe

1. Poke a small hole in the fat end of each egg to pop the air bubble and prevent shell cracking
1. Prepare a bowl with ice water big enough to hold the eggs
1. Bring a pot of water big enough to hold the eggs to a boil
1. Once the water is boiling, use a spider to slowly lower the eggs into the water, then watch the heat to keep it at a simmer
1. Set a timer for 5 minutes and 45 seconds (eggs could probably cook for 6 minutes but if you set your timer for that they will be overcooked by the time you pull the eggs out)
1. Use the spider to pull out the eggs and transfer them to an ice water bath to stop the cooking
1. Peel the eggs underwater to remove the shells more easily
1. Mix all the other ingredients together in a bowl, then transfer the peeled eggs to the marinade, cover with a paper towel to ensure the liquid is touching all sides of the eggs and refrigerate for 12 hours
1. After 12 hours, remove the eggs and store them in an airtight container
