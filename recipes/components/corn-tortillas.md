# Corn Tortillas

Homemade just taste better than anything you can buy at the store, and they're really not hard to make as long as you have something to press them with.

## Ingredients

- [ ] 210g masa harina
- [ ] 1/2 tsp. kosher salt
- [ ] 1/4 tsp. baking powder
- [ ] 2 Tbsp. lard or shmaltz (rendered pork or chicken fat)
- [ ] 2 cups warm water

## Recipe

1. Combine masa, baking powder, lard, and salt in a bowl.
1. Use your hands or a wooden spoon to combine the fat with the rest of the dry ingredients to distribute the fat fairly evenly throughout the mixture
1. Continue to mix the dry ingredients while slowly pouring in warm water until a dough forms. It's very likely you won't need the full amount of water, so don't feel like you need to use it all, you might need anywhere from 1-2 cups depending on various conditions like how old your masa flour is and how dry your climate is
1. Knead the dough with your hands for a few minutes just to incorporate all the water into the masa and the dough is relatively smooth
1. Let the dough rest covered for at least 15 minutes to allow the masa to fully absorb the water
1. Roll out the masa into balls approximately 27-30g in weight
1. Add a light coating of oil to a cast iron skillet over medium heat
1. Fold some wax paper and place the balls of masa in the middle to prevent from sticking to your press
1. Use a tortilla press or a couple of sheet pans to press each tortilla into a 4-5 inch disc, then add to the skillet
1. Cook each tortilla for approximately 2 minutes per side or until it has some nice browning on each side
1. Stack tortillas in a covered container while cooking them, so they can all steam eachother until you're ready to eat
