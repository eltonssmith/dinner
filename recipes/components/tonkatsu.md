# Tonkatsu

Another recipe from "Japanese Soul Cooking" by Tadashi Ono and Harris Salat.
This is a great classic style Japanese curry that could also easily be made
vegan with a few ingredient substitutions while remaining delicious.

## Ingredients

- [ ] 2 fillets boneless pork shoulder or pork loin, about 3/4 inch thick
- [ ] 1 egg
- [ ] 1/4 cup flour
- [ ] 1 cup panko bread crumbs
- [ ] A whole bunch of vegetable oil for deep frying
- [ ] Salt and pepper

## Recipe

1. Place your pork cutlets on a cutting board or other clean flat surface. Use a hammer or other heavy metal flat thing to pound the pork until it's about 1/4 inch thick.
1. Cut some notches into the fatty parts so that the pork won't curl as much when it's immersed in the oil.
1. Season the flattened pork with salt and pepper.
1. Add enough oil to a cast iron skillet so that the oil height is at least 1 inch. Preheat the oil to 350 degrees Fahrenheight (176 C).
1. Mix up the egg and pour it onto a plate.
1. Lay out your flour on a second plate.
1. Lay out your panko on a third plate.
1. One at a time, take a cutlet and dredge first in the flour, then in the egg, then the panko, then stick it into the oil.
1. Deep fry each cutlet for 4 minutes, flipping at least once to make sure you get great browning on all sides.
