# Sous Vide Poached Eggs

Once you make eggs this way, it's hard to go back. I just add the eggs directly to the water bath while still in their shells, and the end result is a perfectly poached egg. You can then just keep them in the fridge (in my experience they last at least a week, but I usually eat them quickly) and use them as topping for reheating leftovers or eat them with your toast or whatever.

## Ingredients

- [ ] Eggs, however many you feel like poaching

## Recipe

1. Heat your water bath to 145 degrees Fahrenheit (62.7 C)
1. Using a slotted spoon or spider, slowly lower the eggs into the water bath and rest them on the bottom
1. Set a timer for 45 minutes
1. Fish out the eggs with your spider or spoon and dry them off, then keep in your fridge either in the carton or in a container so you can remember which ones are the ones you poached
