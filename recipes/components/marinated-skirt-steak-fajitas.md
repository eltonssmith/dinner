# Marinated Skirt Steak Fajitas

Taken from the Alton Brown Good Eats recipe. I love to make this as taco meat. It's a good pairing with [some fresh corn tortilas](./corn-tortillas.md). These days because I'm obsessed with sous vide I like to make it sous vide but you could also just grill it.

## Ingredients

- [ ] 1/2 cup olive oil
- [ ] 1/3 cup soy sauce
- [ ] 1/4 cup lime juice
- [ ] 3 Tbsp. dark brown sugar
- [ ] 4 scallions, thinly sliced
- [ ] 2 cloves of garlic, finely chopped
- [ ] 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes or other dried chiles
- [ ] 1/2 tsp. ground cumin

## Recipe

1. Combine all ingredients in a bowl, using a whisk or a fork to mix. If you want, you can use a blender which can save you the steps of chopping the scallions or garlic, but this introduces a lot of air into the mixture, which makes vacuum sealing for sous vide a bit harder for me, so I tend to go by hand these days
1. Add the marinade to a bag containing 2 lbs of skirt steak and seal. Marinade in the fridge for a few hours
1. Prepare your sous vide according to the the [sous vide steak](../sous-vide-proteins/sous-vide-beef.md) procedure, with a cook time roughly 45-60 minutes, since this is a pretty thin cut of steak
1. Remove from the bag, try to wipe off any garlic or scallions sticking to the mean, and finish off the steak by either quickly throwing it on a very hot grill or broiling it to get some nice browning on both sides
1. Slice very thinly against the grain for the most tender pieces
