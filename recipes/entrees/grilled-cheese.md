# Grilled Cheese Sandwich

The ultimate lazy dinner.

## Ingredients

- [ ] 2 slices of bread (I prefer San Luis Obispo sourdough)
- [ ] 3 slices of thick cut sharp cheddar (or whatever amount of cheese is needed to sufficiently cover two slices of your bread)
- [ ] Salted butter that's been left at room temperature long enough to be soft and easily spreadable

## Recipe

1. Butter one side of each slice of bread
1. Preheat a non-stick pan over medium-low heat
1. Add the bread butter-side-down to the pan
1. Cover the exposed butter-free sides of the bread with the cheese
1. Cook until the cheese is starting to melt a bit
1. Using a spatula, flip one piece of bread over and align it with the other piece to form a sandwich
1. Assuming your heat wasn't too high, you should have nice browning on the outside of the bread and your cheese will be gooey on the inside of the sandwich
1. Serve with some tomato-basil soup or just eat on its own
