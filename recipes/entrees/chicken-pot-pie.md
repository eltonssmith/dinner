# Chicken Pot Pie

This recipe is a bit more like a casserole that's covered with puff pastry rather than an actual pie, but it tastes pretty much the same. From the Alton Brown Good Eats episode.

## Ingredients

- [ ] 1 sheet of frozen puff pastry, cut into squares
- [ ] 3 Tbsp. unsalted butter
- [ ] 1 yellow onion, diced
- [ ] a few stalks of celery, diced (you want approximately the same amount of celery as onion)
- [ ] 4 cups of frozen vegetable medley (something with peas, corn, and carrots at least)
- [ ] 1.5 cups chicken broth
- [ ] 1/2 cup whole milk
- [ ] 3 Tbsp. all purpose flour
- [ ] 2 tsp. dried thyme (can use fresh or dried, but you probably need more if using fresh)
- [ ] 2 tsp. dried parsley (can also use fresh if you have it, but same advice as above)
- [ ] 12 oz. cooked chicken (I usually use leftovers from another meal or sometimes I'll just buy a rotisserie chicken at the grocery store)

## Recipe

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (204 C)
1. Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a straight sided sauted pan or sauce pan if you don't have one, over medium heat
1. Add the onion and celery and a bit of salt, saute for 5 minutes to sweat out the moisture
1. Add the frozen veggies and cook for 8 minutes
1. While the veggies are cooking, combine the milk and chicken broth and microwave for two minutes to bring them nearly to a boil
1. Add the remaining two tablespoons of butter to the veggies, once the butter melts, add the flour and whisk to distribute the flour over all the veggies
1. Add the hot broth and milk mixture and turn up the heat a bit, and cook until the flour causes the mixture to thicken and form a gravy-like sauce
1. Add the thyme and parsley and season with salt and pepper to taste
1. Add the mixture to a glass casserole dish, then cover the mixture with squares of puff pastry until as much of it as possible is covered with a layer of puff pastry
1. Bake for 45 minutes, then allow 30 minutes to cool and allow for the gravy to thicken a bit
