# Miso Soup

## Ingredients

- [ ] One batch of [dashi stock](../components/dashi-stock.md)
- [ ] Two to three generous tablespoons of miso paste (I normally use a lighter miso)
- [ ] One block of extra firm tofu
- [ ] One bunch of scallions
- [ ] One package of shiitake mushrooms (or you can use dried, but rehydrate them first in some hot dashi or water)

## Recipe

1. Place dashi stock in a sauce pan or stock pot, making sure there's enough room for all the liquid plus the extra stuff you plan to put in the soup, set heat to high to bring up to a boil
1. When the dashi is boiling, lower heat and keep at a simmer
1. Drain the tofu and pad away excess moisture from the block
1. Cut the tofu into 3/4 inch to 1 inch cubes
1. Cut scallions into whatever sized slices you like
1. Cut shiitake mushrooms in half (or smaller pieces if you'd like)
1. Throw everything in the pot with the dashi, raise the heat a bit and bring everything up to a boil. Stir until the miso paste has dissolved into the dashi
