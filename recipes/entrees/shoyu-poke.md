# Shoyu Poke

## Ingredients

- [ ] 1 pound of sashimi grade ahi tuna, cut into half-inch cubes
- [ ] 1/4 cup of diced sweet onion
- [ ] 1 Tbsp. Japanese or Hawaiian shoyu (soy sauce)
- [ ] 1 Tbsp. oyster sauce
- [ ] 1 tsp. minced ginger
- [ ] 1 tsp. toasted sesame oil
- [ ] 1/2 tsp. sambal oelek
- [ ] 1/4 cup thinly sliced scallions
- [ ] 1 tsp. roasted sesame seeds
- [ ] Sea salt

## Recipe

Combine all the ingredients in a bowl and mix until everything is incorporated. Add sea salt to season, but use a light touch since the shoyu and oyster sauce will make it fairly salty on its own.

Serve immediately or store covered in the fridge, but you probably want to eat it within a day.
