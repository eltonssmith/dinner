# Egg Fried Rice

A very simple version of egg fried rice that's got some spice and umami. I went down an Uncle Roger rabbit hole on Youtube and this is inspired by watching a bunch of those videos.

## Ingredients

- [ ] 3 Eggs, lightly beaten in a bowl
- [ ] 1-3 Fresno chiles depending on how much spice you like, cut into 0.5 inch pieces
- [ ] 1 mild green pepper, cut into 0.5 inch pieces (the goal here is to have a color contrast, you could also use jalape√±os instead of Fresno and then in this case I'd recommend a red bell pepper)
- [ ] 3-4 scallions, finely sliced with white and green parts separated
- [ ] 2-3 cups of cooked rice that has been refrigerated overnight
- [ ] 1-2 Tbsp. light soy sauce
- [ ] A pinch of MSG or mushroom seasoning

## Recipe

1. Heat up a wok on high heat until it's smoking, then add a few tablespoons of a neutral high smoke point oil (I use avocado oil). Swirl the oil around to coat the pan and get a nice nonstick surface. At this point if you want you can discard the oil and add a bit of fresh oil or just use the same oil if you want to conserve.
1. Add the eggs to the wok, let them sit for 30 seconds or so until they've browned nicely on the bottom, then flip the whole thing like an omelet and cook the other side for another 20-30 seconds.
1. Once the eggs are done, add all the peppers plus the white parts of your scallions and stir fry for like 15 seconds, using this time to also break up the egg with your spoon into small pieces that are incorporated with all the veggies.
1. Add your rice, and use your spoon to break up any clumps so that as many individual grains as possible are loose and able to be coated in the oil.
1. Stir fry everything for another 30-45 seconds, tossing or stirring frequently.
1. Pour your soy sauce around the edge of the wok in a circular motion, allowing it to seep down the side of the wok into the rice in the center.
1. Add your MSG or mushroom seasoning to taste.
1. Give everything a final toss/stir and then serve immediately, topping the dish with the green parts of your scallions.
