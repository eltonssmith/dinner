# Mississippi Pot Roast

I found this recipe on TikTok and although it looked kind of disgusting based on the ingredients, surprisingly the result is greater than the sum of its parts. I thought it would be way too salty from all the seasoning packets you dump into it, but

## Ingredients

- [ ] One 3 lb chuck roast
- [ ] One jar of pepperoncinis (I prefer sliced but they could be whole too)
- [ ] Two packets of McCormick's au jus gravy mix
- [ ] Two packets of Hidden Valley Ranch dressing mix
- [ ] One stick of unsalted butter

## Recipe

1. Grab your instant pot or crock pot and put the chuck roast at the bottom of the bowl
1. Pour in all the pepperoncinis plus the brine, and pour in the seasoning packets, then stick the butter on top
1. If using a crock pot, cook for 8 hours on low heat, or if using an instant pot, pressure cook on high for one hour
