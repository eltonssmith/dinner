# Impossible Chili

My personal recipe for easy one-pot chili. Ever since Impossible Burger became available at Safeway, I've started making all vegan chili all the time. It's just easier in case we have guests over who don't want to eat meat.

## Ingredients

- [ ] 12 oz. Impossible burger, or ground beef or pork if you want some meat
- [ ] 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes (fire roasted are great if you can get them)
- [ ] 15 oz. can of black beans
- [ ] 15 oz. can of pinto or pinquito beans
- [ ] can of hatch chiles or 1-2 diced jalapeño peppers)
- [ ] 1 yellow onion
- [ ] 1 package of [southwest vegetable blend](https://www.instacart.com/image-server/932x932/filters:fill(FFF,true):format(webp)/www.instacart.com/assets/domains/product-image/file/large_861077fb-5d66-449e-b46f-d21681424740.jpeg) or similar veggie mix
- [ ] Chili powder to taste (I usually dump in at least a tablespoon if not more)

## Recipe

1. Chop the onion, I normally just do a quick medium to large dice
1. In a dutch oven or stock pot, saute the onion over medium-low heat with some olive oil, salting the onion a bit to sweat it
1. Once the onion has turned translucent, add the Impossible burger, and turn the heat up to medium, stirring often with a wooden spoon to break up the bits of burger and get them browned all over
1. Dump in your tomatoes, beans, veggies, and jalapeños or other chiles at this point
1. Add however much chili powder tastes correct to you. I also like to add cumin at this time and add salt as needed
1. Turn the heat to low, cover the pot with a lid, and simmer for at least 10-15 minutes, but you could probably let it go for longer. Stir occasionally
1. Serve on its own or maybe with some cornbread
