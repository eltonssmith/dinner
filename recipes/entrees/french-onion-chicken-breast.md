# French Onion Chicken Breast

Inspired by a recipe we saw on TikTok. Original recipe was for porkchops but we like making it with chicken breasts.

## Ingredients

- [ ] 2 large boneless skinless chicken breasts
- [ ] 3 yellow onions, chopped into strips
- [ ] 3 Tbsp. unsalted butter
- [ ] 3 cups beef broth or stock
- [ ] 1 Tbsp. dijon mustard
- [ ] 2 tsp. balsamic vinegar
- [ ] 4 slices of provolone cheese
- [ ] 1 small block of gruyere

## Recipe

1. Preheat your oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 C)
1. Season chicken breasts with salt and pepper
1. Heat up 1 Tbsp. of butter in a skillet or saute pan over medium heat, and add chicken breasts, cooking for a few minutes on each side just to develop some nice browning
1. Transfer seared breasts to a glass casserole dish and set aside
1. Add the remaining 2 Tbsp. of butter to the skillet, and add the onions and salt them a bit to draw out moisture
1. Turn heat to low and saute the onions for 20 minutes or more, until most of the water has evaported from the onions and they're starting to become caramelized
1. Add the beef broth, dijon, and balsamic, saute for another couple of minutes
1. Pour the brothy onion mixture from the skillet into the dish with the chicken, covering the chicken as much as possible
1. Top with slices of gruyere and provolone
1. Bake in the oven for 15 minutes, and finish with 1-2 minutes under the broiler to get good browning on the cheese
