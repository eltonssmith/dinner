# Cacio e Pepe al Limone

My favorite Italian pasta dish is the Roman cacio e pepe. This is a variant of the same idea mixed with pasta al limone, which cuts against some of the fattiness of the pecorino Romano using lemon. There aren't many ingredients here, so definitely use good quality pecorino and don't be afraid to include a lot of pepper. If you ordered this dish in Italy, it'd come served with tonnarelli pasta, but since that's hard to find here in the USA, I recommend using the thickest spaghetti you can find.
