# Dashi Duck Noodle Soup

Really simple but delicious soup to make once you've made a batch of dashi.

## Ingredients

- [ ] 7 oz. duck breast, cooked [sous vide](../sous-vide-proteins/sous-vide-duck.md) with some soy sauce and mirin marinade in the bag, sliced thinly
- [ ] 4 large scallions, cut into 3-inch pieces
- [ ] 2.5 cups [dashi stock](../components/dashi-stock.md)
- [ ] 1/3 cup mirin
- [ ] 1/3 cup soy sauce
- [ ] 7 oz. soba noodles
- [ ] shichimi togarashi or other dried chile flakes

## Recipe

1. Heat the dashi stock, soy sauce, and mirin in a sauce pan or stock pot until it comes to a low boil. If you cooked the duck sous vide, I like to add all the juices from the bag to the soup as well at this point
1. In another pot, boil some water and add a bit of salt
1. Once the liquid is boiling, add the duck meat and cook for a minute, then add the scallions and cook for another minute
1. Cook your soba noodles in the pot of boiling water until al dente
1. Makes two servings. Serve by portioning out half the soup, scallions, and duck into two bowls, then add half the noodles to each bowl and eat immediately
