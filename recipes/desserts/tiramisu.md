# Tiramisu

Classic Italian dessert. This is a recipe I learned in a cooking class when I visited Rome.

## Ingredients

- [ ] 40g sugar, plus some extra for the coffee
- [ ] 2 eggs, whites and yolks separated
- [ ] 1 cup of coffee (whatever kind you like, I suppose)
- [ ] 200g mascarpone
- [ ] Ladyfinger biscuits (one package?)

## Recipe

1. Using a hand mixer or stand mixer with a whisk attachment, beat sugar and egg yolks for approximately 7 minutes, until the mixture is very smooth.
1. In a different bowl using the same mixer, whisk the egg whites until they're stiff enough that you can turn the bowl upside-down
1. Make some coffee according to your favorite coffee-making method, mix in a couple of spoonfuls of sugar according to your preference
1. Mix the mascarpone with the egg/sugar mixture until integrated
1. Fold in the egg whites just enough to incorporate them into the custard
1. Dip the lady fingers in the coffee, then place a layer of coffee-dipped biscuits in the bottom of a bowl or baking dish. Top the biscuits with a layer of the egg and mascarpone cream, then top with another layer of biscuits, and keep alternating layers until you've filled the bowl/dish
