# Yuzu Sherbet

Based on David Chang's recipe from Momofuku, but made with yuzu juice. You wouldn't think ice cream this simple and made with sour cream would be so good, but the citrus really complements it well.

## Ingredients

- [ ] One tub of sour cream (454g)
- [ ] One cup of sugar (200g)
- [ ] 3/4 cup of water (50g)
- [ ] 3 Tbsp. yuzu juice (you can find this at a Japanese grocery store)

## Recipe

1. Add the sugar and water to a small saucepan and bring to a simmer, stirring often, until a clear syrup forms, then allow this to cool before proceeding
1. Add the sour cream to a bowl and whisk a bit to get out any lumps and smooth it out
1. Add the syrup and juice, then whisk until the whole mixture is well incorporated
1. Cover and refrigerate until the whole mixture is cold
1. Start your ice cream maker and add the mixture to it, following your specific machine's process. For me, I use a Cuisinart ice cream maker that slowly churns using a giant frozen tub, and I'd say it takes maybe 30 minutes to reach a good soft serve consistency
