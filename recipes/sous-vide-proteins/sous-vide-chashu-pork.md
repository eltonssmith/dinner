# Sous Vide Chashu Pork

Taken from [this ramen recipe I found online](https://glebekitchen.com/tonkotsu-ramen-home/).

## Ingredients

- [ ] 2 lbs of pork belly
- [ ] 1/4 cup soy sauce
- [ ] 1/2 cup mirin
- [ ] 1/2 cup sake
- [ ] 1/4 cup sugar
- [ ] 2-3 whole garlic cloves
- [ ] 2 green onions or scallions, chopped into 1-inch pieces

## Recipe

1. Mix everything but the pork belly in a bowl to combine
1. Tie the pork belly into a roll using string
1. If the roll is too big to fit into your sous vide plastic bags, you may need to cut it up into pieces
1. Pour the marinade into the bag with the pork and vacuum seal it
1. Set your sous vide water bath to 170 degrees Fahrenheit (76.7 C)
1. Cook the pork for 10-12 hours
1. Remove the bag from the water bath, and refrigerate pork for several hours
1. Once the pork has chilled, it should be much easier to slice into think pieces which can be served with ramen or maybe made into a very tasty sandwich?
