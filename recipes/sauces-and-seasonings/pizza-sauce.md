# Pizza Sauce

A very simple red sauce that doesn't need cooking. Could maybe use it for other things but I really just use this for pizza.

## Ingredients

- [ ] One 14.5 oz can of tomatoes (I like fire roasted for a bit more flavor)
- [ ] 1-2 cloves of garlic
- [ ] 1 Tbsp. olive oil
- [ ] A generous amount of dried oregano (I normally use Sicilian)
- [ ] Kosher salt

## Recipe

1. Combine the tomatoes, garlic, olive oil in a blender
1. Blend until a smooth sauce forms
1. Season with salt and oregano according to your taste
