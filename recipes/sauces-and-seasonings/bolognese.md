# Bolognese

The best sauce for when you want to make some fresh pasta or just serve up some
spaghetti. This recipe can be made with all kinds of meats or probably even
just with impossible burger or mushrooms if you are so inclined. I don't really
have a lot of specific measurements here because I just make this sauce purely
by feel.

## Ingredients

- [ ] Two big cans of crushed San Marzano tomatoes
- [ ] Two yellow onions, finely diced
- [ ] A couple of ribs of celery, finely diced
- [ ] A couple of carrots, finely diced (you want roughly the same amount of your onion, carrot, and celery, all roughly the same sized dice)
- [ ] 1 pound of pancetta
- [ ] 1 pound of ground lamb
- [ ] 1 pound of ground veal (you can be pretty liberal with what kind of meat you use here, lots of different combinations will work)
- [ ] About half a bottle of red wine
- [ ] Dried or fresh shiitake mushrooms
- [ ] A bunch of each of the following herbs: basil, rosemary, thyme, sage, oregano
- [ ] Beef stock

## Recipe

1. Slice your pancetta into small cubes or strips
1. In a dutch oven or large pot, heat up a bit of olive oil on medium heat, then add the pancetta, cooking to render out the fat and get it nice and crispy
1. Remove the pancetta with a slotted spoon, and cook the other meats in the pancetta fat
1. Remove all the meats to a bowl or plate, then add the onions and saute for a few minutes, adding a bit of oil if necessary
1. Add the celery and carrots to the mixture and continue to saute until the vegetables are a bit soft
1. Add back in the meat and pour in the wine and tomatoes, turn up the heat and bring to a low boil
1. Add your mushrooms. If you used dried mushrooms heat up a bit of stock and use
   that to rehydrate your mushrooms first
1. Finely chop all of the herbs and pour them into the mixture
1. If the sauce is too thick, maybe add some of the beef stock or other stock that you chose to use
1. Let this whole thing mix and simmer on the stove for at least an hour to allow the flavors to meld
1. Season liberally with kosher salt
1. Serve with any kind of pasta, but the kind I like would be tagliatelle or pappardelle,
   as that's what you're likely to get in Bologna
