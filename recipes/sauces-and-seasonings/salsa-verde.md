# Salsa Verde

## Ingredients

- [ ] 6-8 Tomatillos, cut in half
- [ ] 1/2 Onion, cut in half again and with some layers peeled apart
- [ ] 1 bunch Cilantro
- [ ] 3 cloves Garlic
- [ ] 1 or more Serrano chiles (depends on how spicy you like it), cut in half
- [ ] Salt

## Recipe

1. Spread out all the cut tomatillos, onion, and chiles on a sheet pan with the tomatillos and chiles skin side up
1. Turn on your oven's broiler and put the veggies under the broiler until all the skins have blackened (for me, this is 10-20 minutes)
1. Near the end of the broiling, add the garlic to your sheet pan as well to char it a bit
1. Pull out the sheet pan and carefully transfer all the hot contents into your blender
1. Blend all ingredients until there are no chunks left, but the mixture should not be a smooth puree
1. Add as much cilantro as you desire. I'll usually take all the leaves off a bunch and leave the stems out. Up to you though.
1. Season with salt to taste. I find that several pinches of kosher salt is a good amount
