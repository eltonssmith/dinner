# Mac Salad

From Sheldon Simeon's "Cook Real Hawaii" book. Yes, that is 3 cups of mayo. Trust me, it seems like too much but its the right amount.

## Ingredients

- [ ] 8 oz. macaroni
- [ ] 1 lb russet potatoes (one good sized one should do it)
- [ ] 4 hard boiled eggs
- [ ] 3 cups of mayonaise (don't use kewpie mayo, regular American mayo is best)
- [ ] 1 Tbsp. garlic salt
- [ ] 1 tsp. black pepper
- [ ] 1 carrot

## Recipe

1. Peel the potato and chop into 1/2 inch cubes
1. Roughly chop the hard boiled eggs
1. Grate the carrot using a cheese grater
1. Boil the macaroni in a pot of salted water for a few minutes longer than the directions say. You don't want it to be al dente, you want it to be just a bit mushy. Chill it in the fridge
1. Change out the water for some new salted water and boil the potatos until soft, about 10 minutes
1. Mix together the eggs, mayo, garlic salt, pepper, and carrots to form a smooth mixture, then fold in the potatoes and macaroni.
1. Ideally let this whole concoction chill in the fridge for at least 30 minutes to allow everything to meld together before serving
