# Quick Dill Pickles

Taken from the fantastic Mission Chinese cookbook, where he unexpectedly has some banger BBQ recipes. These are intended as a compliment to some [Sous Vide BBQ Brisket](../sous-vide-proteins/sous-vide-bbq-brisket.md)., but are also just a delicious snack.

## Ingredients

- [ ] 1 pound Persian or Kirby cucumbers, cut into quarter-inch medallions
- [ ] 1/2 a white onion, cut into thin slices
- [ ] 1 clove's worth of minced garlic
- [ ] 2 sprigs of dill, chopped
- [ ] 1.5 tsp. whole black peppercorns
- [ ] 1.5 tsp. fennel seeds
- [ ] 1 tsp. red pepper flakes
- [ ] 1+ cups of distilled white vinegar
- [ ] Kosher salt

## Recipe

1. Mix up the cucumber and sliced onion in a bowl and salt them until they reach the level of salt you'd like to taste in the final pickle
1. Add the minced garlic, chopped dill, peppercorns, fennel seeds, and red pepper flakes and mix them all together
1. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and leave in the fridge overnight
1. The next day, drain away all the liquid that has accumulated in the bowl and cover the vegetables in white vinegar
1. Leave everything to soak in the vinegar for 3-4 hours in the fridge
1. Drain off the vinegar and store in an airtight container for up to a week
