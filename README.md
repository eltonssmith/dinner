# Dave Does Dinner

Food I've cooked that I'd like to cook again. I only tend to add stuff to this
list if I've cooked it at least twice and enjoyed it each time. This is kind of
my digital version of that notebook that your grandma would keep with all her
recipes in it.

Everything here is categorized according to my own weird system that may not
make sense. A lot of things here are just components that can be used within
larger dishes or mixed and matched.

If you happen to be reading this, hope you find it useful.
